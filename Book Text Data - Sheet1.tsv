I am a very old man; how old I do not know. Possibly I am a hundred, possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I have always been a man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection. I do not know why I should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality. Because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death. I cannot explain the phenomena; I can only set down here the words of truth. I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate.
My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in everything but the management of his family, of which he had the total control, having been unfortunately deprived of the society of his wife at the time of the birth of their second son. My parents had given me the education which a fortune of more than moderate ease could afford, and I was, in every respect, a remarkably well-behaved and intelligent boy. The sea had always exercised a strong influence over my imagination, and many of the most intense and most pleasurable hours of my early boyhood were spent in poring over the pages of old voyages, especially those of Captain Cook, and in relating the adventurous deeds of travelers who had penetrated into the remote regions of the world. This desire to travel had been long growing in my mind. I had made many voyages with a friend of mine, Augustus Barnard — son of Barnard, a captain in the merchant service — and sometimes we were absent from home for days together.
I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days — found myself doubtful again, seemed to myself, I suppose, a fool; had had nothing from him but a charming dinner and the glimpse of a great possibility; had found myself, for it so fell out, at the end of forty-eight hours, at the house of a friend in London. It was ten o’clock at night, and the house was still — it was all the more still the dim summer dusk was deepening — and I sat for an hour, dazed, as it were, in the flicker of the fire. He had told me so little — told me nothing, in fact, but that he had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small boy and girl, children of a younger and a favorite brother, that he had been requested by the dying man to take them, and that, in the interest of their education, he was keen to place them in a country home, under the care of a young woman he could absolutely trust.
When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again. I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained.
Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnam Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess, the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical changes, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire. “Hark at the wind,” said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it. “I’m listening,” said the latter grimly, surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. “Check.” “I should hardly think that he’d come to-night,” said his father, with his hand poised over the board.
In the country of Westphalia, in the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh, lived a young man whom nature had endowed with the most agreeable manners. His countenance was the true index of his mind. He had a solid judgment joined to the most unaffected simplicity; and hence, I presume, he was called Candide. The old servants of the house suspected that he was the son of the Baron’s sister, by a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would never marry because he had not the quarterings of nobility. The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had a door and windows. His great hall even bore a tapestry. All the dogs of his farmyards composed a hunting pack in time of need. His grooms were his huntsmen, and the curate of the village was his chaplain. They all called him My Lord, and laughed when he told stories.
From my grandfather Verus, [I learned] good morals and the government of my temper. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally. From my governor, to endure labour, and to want little; to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people's affairs; and not to accept favors from others...
The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it): "To any one who has studied geometry, the truth that Time is only a kind of Space is a familiar as well as an uncontroversial conclusion. But I have experimental verification. It would be remarkably easy to show you. For instance, here is a four-dimensional diagram..."
It was four o'clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive. There had been some delay at the church, and the reception had to be shortened. There was no great loss, however, for there was only a hired hall and a few decorations, and the guests were in no mood to lose time. It was a Lithuanian wedding, and they had made all the preparations themselves, with only the help of a caterer and a few hired waiters. Now that the vows had been said, they could eat and drink and be merry. The hall was in the back room of a saloon, and already there was music and dancing and laughter. In the corner was a band, drawn from all the talents of the neighborhood — fiddles and a cimbalom, with one solitary harp-like instrument, and a bass viol as large as a man. There were tables and tables of food — roast pork and stewed chicken, boiled potatoes and cabbage, and great piles of rye bread. There was homemade beer and homemade sausage, and even homemade wine.
In the Valley of Doom, on the edge of the Land of Fable, where the mountains of Zark find their ending, and the country is of gentle hills and little valleys full of the sound of streams, there lies a village called Somnalin. It is a very little village, with no road leading to it, so that no one has ever been there except by chance, and only a few by chance ever find it again. A few forsaken cottages and one or two small gardens, with flowers that grow nowhere else in the world, stand here and there about the village. And once there came to Somnalin the Man-Horse. Whence he came none knew, for he was of the stock of the Centaurs. But the Centaurs live in the glades of myth, and not in the fields we know.
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversation?” So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet…
I have often been asked how I first came to be a regular opium-eater, and have suffered some pain in answering the question. The answer, however, is simple enough, and the reader may be assured that I have no vanity to gratify in detailing the circumstances, as I have no reason to think that opium, even taken in moderation, has ever been any source of happiness to me. On the contrary, it has been for many years a source of severe sufferings and the object of a profound abhorrence. I took it: — in the first instance to check a nervous complaint — in the second, as an article of daily diet — in the third, as a solace for the miseries of a life of solitude and hard study. The pleasures which I have at any time derived from opium are neither very great nor very numerous; but I must try to recal them, as an act of justice to the drug. I was a hard student at Oxford — morbidly ambitious of intellectual distinctions, and well content to sacrifice all ordinary pleasures to them. My life was so quiet and monotonous, that even this brief statement seems a history.
The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name.The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.
Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule. We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Memo: get recipe for Mina.)
The will to truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect — what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story — yet it seems as if it were hardly begun. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? What in us really wants “truth”? Indeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause of this will — until we finally came to a complete standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We asked about the value of this will. Suppose we want truth: why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth stepped before us — or was it we who stepped before the problem?
Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said that he resembled Byron—at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old. Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on ’Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the “City”; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln’s Inn, or Gray’s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen’s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan’s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.
I was scarcely more than a boy when I first entered the army, and was immediately ordered out to join the troops in the campaign against the Turks. I had not yet grown the famous mustaches you now see — but I was strong, alert, and full of that fire and spirit which youth and honor inspire. I had scarcely reached the army before I distinguished myself. A detachment of the enemy had made a sudden attack on our outposts. The general, alarmed, called for a volunteer to carry orders to a distant regiment. I sprang forward at once. My horse was fleet, my courage high — I set off at full gallop, leaping hedge and ditch, river and ravine. At one moment, finding myself pursued by a squad of Turkish horsemen, I turned suddenly, fired both my pistols, and — would you believe it? — brought down three of them with two bullets! The third must have passed through the first man and lodged in the second. Such things are not uncommon with me.
Something there is that doesn’t love a wall, That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, And spills the upper boulders in the sun; And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there.
Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised. It is the only form of adventure in which you pack your troubles together and take them with you. The men who go out into the white world with sledges know that they may have to face a year or more of a life in which pain and discomfort are almost continual, and danger a frequent companion. There is a philosophical element in the preparation for such a journey, and the minds of those who undertake it must be toughened and trained to meet and endure hardship with stoicism and without complaint. Exploration for exploration’s sake is a good thing. The spirit which leads a man to endure hardness is as good a reason as any for doing it. The better the reason the more likely is he to do it thoroughly. To go and do something dangerous because somebody has to do it and you think you can do it as well as anybody else — that is good, too.
There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.
It is an ancyent Marinere, And he stoppeth one of three: “By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye, Now wherefore stoppest me? The Bridegroom’s doors are open’d wide, And I am next of kin; The Guests are met, the Feast is set,— May’st hear the merry din.” He holds him with his skinny hand, “There was a ship,” quoth he. “Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!” Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean toward each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter — but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness — a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the Sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild. But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapor that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow.
Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost. Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars.
The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the worldwide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend, Hercule Poirot, and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist. I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair. I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month’s sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior — an easy-going, rather sleepy-looking fellow, though he could be exceedingly energetic when he chose.
All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities. Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new. The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza; or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the Kingdom of Naples to the King of Spain. Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser, and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada, or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana.
Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with eagerness the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the promises of youth, and that the deficiencies of the present day will be supplied by the morrow; attend to the history of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia. Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty emperor, in whose dominions the Father of Waters begins his course—whose bounty pours down the streams of plenty, and scatters over half the world the harvests of Egypt. According to the custom which has descended from age to age among the monarchs of the torrid zone, Rasselas was confined in a private palace, with the other sons and daughters of Abyssinian royalty, till the order of succession should call him to the throne. The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the residence of the princes of the empire was a spacious valley in the kingdom of Amhara, surrounded on every side by lofty mountains.
Why, my dear Lucilius, do we complain of Nature? She has acted kindly; life, if you reckon its length by the standard of pleasure, is long; if by the standard of Nature, it is short: Nature has given us but a brief span, yet ample enough for virtuous living. But if we squander life in luxury and carelessness, and if we waste it on no worthy pursuit, when the hour arrives in which we must die, we perceive that we have not truly lived. Life is long if you know how to use it. You ask, then, why misfortune befalls good men? No evil can happen to a good man: contraries cannot combine. As light does not mingle with darkness, so virtue does not mix with misfortune.
It was the custom of the people to say, in the month of July, 1665, that a dreadful sickness was coming. The air was hot and oppressive, and the people felt a general unease. By the middle of June, the streets of London became deserted, and those who remained in the city looked apprehensive. The sick were soon seen in every part of the town, and those who were well began to stay indoors, fearing the infection. By the end of the month, the first cases of the plague were being reported, and it was clear that a pestilence was spreading rapidly. The city's authorities began to take notice, and it was soon evident that the danger was real. Families began to shut themselves away, hoping to avoid the disease. It was said that the first few deaths were so sudden and severe that people could hardly believe the news. As more bodies were carried out, and the burial grounds began to fill, the gravity of the situation became undeniable.
I was born in Boston, New England, on the 17th day of January, 1706. My father was a tallow-chandler and soap-boiler, a business that he carried on for some years. He was a pious, sensible, and very frugal man, and, as I later understood, his business provided a decent income for the family. I had a number of siblings, and my parents provided us with the essentials for our upbringing. When I was about ten years old, my father had me apprenticed to my brother James, a printer, with whom I learned the trade. James had a printing house in which he printed a newspaper, the New-England Courant. This was the first opportunity I had to work with books and the printed word, and it sparked a lifelong interest in reading and writing. Though my father was well-meaning in putting me to work with my brother, it was a difficult apprenticeship. My brother was strict, and at times, I felt as though he was too harsh. But the work taught me a great deal about the printing trade and, more importantly, the value of self-reliance and perseverance.
Chapter I: Of the Nature of God and the Universe The first and most fundamental principle of religion is the belief in a God, a supreme being who is the creator and governor of the universe. It is evident that the whole system of nature, with all its parts and operations, is governed by an intelligence far superior to the human mind. This intelligence, which we call God, is the cause of all things, both in their formation and their order. The universe, in its structure and workings, manifests the wisdom and power of this supreme being. Everything in nature is orderly, purposeful, and suited to the needs of the creatures that inhabit it. From the smallest particle of matter to the largest celestial body, all things are arranged with such precision and harmony that it is impossible not to recognize the hand of the Creator. That God is the origin of all things is evident from the very existence of the world around us. For nothing can come from nothing. The idea of a self-existent universe is absurd, and to believe that it sprang from mere chance is equally so. Therefore, we must conclude that there is an eternal, necessary being—God—who brought everything into being. This first principle, that God is the Creator of the universe, is the foundation of all true religion. For if there is a God, then it follows that He must be the ruler of the universe as well, governing all things according to His will and wisdom. The belief in a just and wise God provides the basis for morality and the practice of virtue, as we will see in the following chapters.
The Castle of Otranto 1764 Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter, a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda. Conrad, the son, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising disposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any symptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for his son with the Marquis of Vicenza’s daughter, Isabella; and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad’s infirm state of health would permit.
ISIR, was born at Segovia, my father’s name was Clemente Pablo, a native of the same town; may God keep him in heaven. I need not speak of his virtues, for those are unknown, but by trade he was a barber, though so high minded, that he took it for an affront to be called by any name but that of a cheek-shearer and beard-tailor. They say he came of a good stock, and his actions showed it. He was married to Aldonza Saturno de Rebollo, daughter to Octavio de Rebollo Codillo, and grandchild to Lepido Ziuraconte. The town foully suspected that she was no old Christian,[3] though she strongly urged the names of her progenitors, to prove herself descended from those great men that formed the Triumvirate at Rome. She was very handsome, and so famous, that all the ballad rhymers of her time made verses of her, which were sung about the streets. She ran through many troubles, when first married, and long after, for there were scandalous tongues in the neighbourhood that did not stick to say my father was willing to wear the horns, provided they were tipped with gold. It was proved upon him, that whilst he was lathering the beards of those he was to trim, a small brother of mine, about seven years of age, rifled their pockets. The little angel died of a whipping he had in the gaol; and my father was much concerned at the loss, because he won the hearts of them all. He was himself a while in prison for some small trifles of this nature; but I am told he came off so honourably, that at his first walking abroad from gaol two hundred cardinals went behind him, of whom ne’er a one was monsignor,[4] and the ladies stood at their windows to see him pass by; for my father always made a good figure, either a-foot or a-horseback. I do not speak it out of vanity, for everybody knows that to be foreign to me.
MAY 4. How happy I am that I am gone! My dear friend, what a thing is the heart of man! To leave you, from whom I have been inseparable, whom I love so dearly, and yet to feel happy! I know you will forgive me. Have not other attachments been specially appointed by fate to torment a head like mine? Poor Leonora! And yet I was not to blame. Could I help it, that while the characteristics of her charming qualities amused me, my passion entirely vanished? And alas! Am I not myself the most miserable creature under the sun? My own caprices bring me daily into fresh embarrassments. But, ah! what a heart I have! Sometimes I cannot comprehend it. To be sure, it is but too often the sport of my own humour. Otherwise, I should not be here. I had a mind to spend a few days in a neighbouring village, and took up my abode with a good woman, who keeps a little public house: her children are very fond of me, particularly a little girl of eight years old, with whom I am very intimate. I have already become a great favourite in the neighbourhood. They are frank, open-hearted people; and I have, in my solitude, so much at my leisure as I could desire. — My friend, when I sometimes lie stretched on the grass by the side of the murmuring brook, and watch the clouds that flit across the sky, or the flickering flight of the rook, which is skimming past me, and then recall the various wonderful qualities of man; alas! when I reflect on the noble sentiments which warmed the hearts of the ancient world, and which now exist only in name, — when I think of the toils and sufferings in pursuit of barely a subsistence, and the ceaseless misrepresentations in even the most trivial matters, — when I behold the man of limited capacity, puffed up with the conceit of his own perfection, and the more distinguished man content to wallow in vulgar enjoyment, — I feel convinced that I have often been in the wrong, for I am prone to error. But in this I am right: — O, my dear friend! — the happiness of man, in this world, is composed of so many minute particles, that the keenest eye cannot discern them all.
CHAPTER I—START IN LIFE​ I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.​I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.​
A shepherd, who had been long in the service of a king, was one day dismissed from his employment. He retired to a small cottage in the country, where he lived in peace and contentment. One day, as he was tending his flock, he saw the king passing by in his carriage. The king recognized the shepherd and stopped to speak with him. "How are you, my good friend?" asked the king. "I am well, your majesty," replied the shepherd. "And how is your flock?" asked the king. "They are well, your majesty," replied the shepherd. "And how is your wife?" asked the king. "She is well, your majesty," replied the shepherd. "And how is your life?" asked the king. "It is well, your majesty," replied the shepherd. The king then said, "I envy you, my good friend. You have everything you need and live a life of peace and contentment. I, on the other hand, am burdened with the cares of ruling a kingdom." The shepherd replied, "Your majesty, I have learned that happiness does not come from wealth or power, but from living a simple and contented life." The king thanked the shepherd for his wisdom and continued on his way.
"Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has been rightly declared to be that at which all things aim. But if there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else, for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good. If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else, for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good."
Scene I. A Room in Faustus' House. Enter Faustus and his Scholars. Faustus: Now that the gloomy shadow of the night, Longing to view the object of her care, Reigns over the vast horizon, and the air Seemeth to turn to liquid silver, I'll summon forth my mighty thoughts to work The great ends of my destiny. Come, scholars, be with me, as we attempt The power of knowledge which, though banned by time, Shall, in our daring hands, raise us to glory. (Aside.) First Scholar: My Faustus, it is impossible for us To stand before the light of heaven's wrath, For that which comes from Heaven cannot be tainted. It must be pure, and sinless, in its way. You grasp for something more than we can reach! Faustus: O, my brothers, the soul of man may reach For knowledge deeper than the stars can show! Let's then raise our minds above the mortal grasp, To seek the secrets of eternity, Which lie within the scrolls of ancient sages, And burn with a fire that shall never die.
Act I, Scene I Enter Face, in a captain's uniform, with his sword drawn, and Subtle with a vial, quarrelling, and followed by Dol Common. Face: I’ll flea thee, and then I’ll teach thee to know thy betters. Subtle: Thou art a rogue. Face: I’ll make thee know thy betters. Subtle: Thou art a rogue. Face: I’ll make thee know thy betters. Subtle: Thou art a rogue. Face: I’ll make thee know thy betters. Subtle: Thou art a rogue. Face: I’ll make thee know thy betters. Subtle: Thou art a rogue. Face: I’ll make thee know thy betters. Subtle: Thou art a rogue.
All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs, and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. The Belgae are the strongest of all the Gauls, because they are the farthest from the civilization and refinement of our province, and merchants rarely travel to them, and they import very little. For which reason the Belgae are also the bravest, because the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, are accustomed to make incursions into their territory, and they are often engaged in wars with them.
Act I, Scene I Enter Justice Shallow, Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans. Shallow: All his successors gone before him have done it; and all his ancestors that come after him may: they may give the dozen white luces in their coat. Sir Hugh Evans: The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love. Shallow: The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat. Act I, Scene I (Continued) Shallow: To Slender What news? what news? how does the world? Slender: I thank you, sir. I am glad to see you, I hope you are well. Shallow: I am very well, I thank you. What news, sir? Slender: I have heard that the world is full of fools. Shallow: I will not believe that. Sir Hugh Evans: I think the world is full of fools too.
Prologue Enter Chorus. Chorus: O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention! A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, And monarchs to behold the swelling scene! Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels, Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all, The flat unraised spirits that have dared On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object: can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of France? or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt? O pardon! since a crooked figure may Attest in little place a million; And let us, ciphers to this great accompt, On your imaginary forces work. Suppose within the girdle of these walls Are now confined two mighty monarchies, Whose high upreared and abutting fronts The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder. Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts; Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance; Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth; For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times, Turning the accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass: for the which supply, Admit me Chorus to this history; Who prologue-like your humble patience pray, Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.
Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain, but upon taking of cold. I lived in Axe Yard, having my wife and servant Jane, and no more in family than us three. My wife gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year, the hope was belied. The condition of the State was thus; viz. the Rump, after being disturbed by my Lord Lambert, was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the Army all forced to yield. Lawson lies still in the river, and Monk is with his army in Scotland. After dinner, my wife and I went to the playhouse, and there saw a most excellent performance of "The Maid's Tragedy." I was in great delight with it, and it gave me much satisfaction to see the actors perform so well. The theatre was crowded, and we had a good view of the stage. After the play, we returned home and spent the rest of the evening quietly. My wife was in good spirits, and we had a comfortable time together.
The Argument This first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject, Mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac't: Then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the command of God driven out of Heaven, with all his Crew, into the great Deep. Which action past over, the Poem hastes into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, described here, not in the Center (for Heaven and Earth may be supposed as yet not made certainly) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest call'd Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion; calls up him who, in the Serpent, had seduc'd them to that revolt; and in the Serpent, to the Serpent had brought them into this place of torment.
Birth and Parentage Julius Caesar was born on the 12th of July, in the year 100 B.C., into the Julian gens, a family that traced its origins back to Iulus, the son of Aeneas, the Trojan hero. His father, Gaius Julius Caesar, was a praetor who governed the province of Asia, and his mother, Aurelia Cotta, was the daughter of a distinguished senator. 2. Early Life and Education Caesar's early years were marked by political strife and family pressure. His family had been prominent, but had also experienced a series of downfalls. He was a student of rhetoric and philosophy in Rome, and later studied under the renowned teacher Apollonius of Rhodes. His studies were interrupted when, at the age of sixteen, his father died, and he was thrust into the responsibilities of family leadership. 3. His Early Career and Rise to Power Upon reaching the age of military service, Caesar began his career in the army, where he gained a reputation for bravery and leadership. He served under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and later in Cilicia, where he earned the admiration of his superiors and the loyalty of his men. At one point, he was captured by pirates during a journey and held for ransom. During his captivity, he maintained a bold and commanding presence, and upon being released, he raised a fleet and captured the pirates, executing them as punishment.
Prologue So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns. There was Shield Sheafson, scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of mead-benches, rampaging among foes. This terror of the hall-troops had come far. A foundling to start with, he would flourish later on as his powers waxed and his worth was proved. In the end each clan on the outlying coasts beyond the whale-road had to yield to him and begin to pay tribute. That was one good king.
The Quarrel Between Agamemnon and Achilles Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first drew the sword. The Quarrel Between Agamemnon and Achilles Declare, O Muses, which god provoked this wayward pair? It was Apollo, the son of Jove and Leto, against the will of all the gods, who sent a plague upon the Greeks. For they had dishonored Chryses, priest of Apollo, by refusing to return his daughter, whom they had taken captive in their raids. The priest came to the camp of the Greeks to ransom his daughter, bringing with him a ransom of great value and the holy symbol of Apollo. But the army refused to release his daughter, and the priest prayed to Apollo to punish the Greeks for their wrong.
The Gods in Council Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.
Act 1, Scene 1 Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger. LEONATO: I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon comes this night to Messina.​ Messenger: He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.​ LEONATO: How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?​ Messenger: But few of any sort, and none of name.​ LEONATO: A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.​ Messenger: Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.​ LEONATO: He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.​ Messenger: I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough among the moderation of his joy.​ LEONATO: I am glad to see him, but I am sorry that he is not here.
Chapter II wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what they were then doing;—that not only the production of a rational Being was concerned in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind;—and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost;—Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly,—I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from that in which the reader is likely to see me.—Believe me, good folks, this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it;—you have all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as how they are transfused from father to son, &c. &c.—and a great deal to that purpose:—Well, you may take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his nonsense, his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity, and the different tracks and trains you put them into, so that when they are once set a-going, whether right or wrong, 'tis not a half-penny matter,—away they go cluttering like hey-go-mad; and by treading the same steps over and over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain and as smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.
Venus and Adonis By William Shakespeare The Argument Venus, the goddess of love, falls in love with the young and handsome Adonis, who is more interested in hunting than in love. Despite her passionate advances, Adonis remains indifferent, preferring to hunt wild boar. Eventually, he is killed by the boar, and Venus mourns his death, lamenting the fleeting nature of beauty and life.​
As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back.​I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, What shall I do?​
Book I, Chapter I First, How Uther Pendragon Sent for the Duke of Cornwall and Igraine His Wife, and of Their Departing Suddenly Again It befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that held war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of Tintagil. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him to bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a passing wise, and her name was called Igraine.​So when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of great lords they were accorded both. The king liked and loved this lady well, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have lain by her. But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent unto the king. And then she told the duke her husband, and said, I suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore, husband, I counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may ride all night unto our own castle. And in like wise as she said so they departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware of their departing.​ All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing so suddenly, he was wonderly wroth. Then he called to him his privy council, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his wife. Then they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great charge; and if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your best, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him. So that was done, and the messengers had their answers; and that was this shortly, that neither he nor his wife would not come at him.​When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and garnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight Tintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine he put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he put in the castle of Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out. Then in all haste came Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of Terrabil.​
Act 1, Scene 1 Enter Sampson and Gregory, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers. Sampson: Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. Gregory: No, for then we should be colliers. Sampson: I mean, and we be in choler, we'll draw. Gregory: Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar. Sampson: I strike quickly, being moved. Gregory: But thou art not quickly moved to strike. Sampson: A dog of the house of Montague moves me. Gregory: To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. Sampson: A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. Gregory: That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. Sampson: True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. Gregory: The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. Sampson: 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids, and cut off their heads. Gregory: The heads of the maids? Sampson: Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt. Gregory: They must take it in sense that feel it. Sampson: Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. Gregory: 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes two of the house of the Montagues. Sampson: My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. Gregory: How? turn thy back and run? Sampson: Fear me not. Gregory: No, marry; I fear thee! Sampson: Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. Gregory: I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
ACT I, SCENE I Rome. A street. Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners. FLAVIUS Hence! home, you idle creatures, get you home: Is this a holiday? What! know you not, Being mechanical, you ought not walk Upon a labouring day without the sign Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou? First Commoner Why, sir, a carpenter. MARULLUS Where is thy leather apron and thy rule? What dost thou with thy best apparel on? You, sir, what trade are you? Second Commoner Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler. MARULLUS But what trade art thou? Answer me directly. Second Commoner A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles. FLAVIUS What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade? Second Commoner Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you. MARULLUS What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow! Second Commoner Why, sir, cobble you.
THE TRAGEDY OF KING RICHARD THE SECOND ACT I, SCENE I London. King Richard’s palace. Enter KING RICHARD, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants. KING RICHARD. Old John of Gaunt, time-honour’d Lancaster, Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, Which then our leisure would not let us hear, Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? GAUNT. I have, my liege. KING RICHARD. Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, If he appeal the duke on ancient malice, Or worthily, as a good subject should, On some known ground of treachery in him? GAUNT. As near as I could sift him on that argument, On some apparent danger seen in him Aim’d at your highness, no inveterate malice. KING RICHARD. Then call them to our presence: face to face, And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak: High-stomach’d are they both, and full of ire, In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY. BOLINGBROKE. Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
CHAPTER I Imitating Christ and Despising All Vanities on Earth “He who follows Me, walks not in darkness,” says the Lord. By these words of Christ we are advised to imitate His life and habits, if we wish to be truly enlightened and free from all blindness of heart. Let our chief effort, therefore, be to study the life of Jesus Christ. The teaching of Christ is more excellent than all the advice of the saints, and he who has His Spirit will find in it a hidden manna. Now, there are many who frequently hear the Gospel but care little for it because they have not the spirit of Christ. Yet whoever wishes to understand fully the words of Christ must try to pattern his whole life on that of Christ. What good does it do to speak learnedly about the Trinity if, lacking humility, you displease the Trinity? Indeed it is not learning that makes a man holy and just, but a virtuous life makes him pleasing to God. I would rather feel contrition than know how to define it. If you knew the whole Bible by heart, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what good would it all be without the love and grace of God? “Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity,” except to love God and serve Him alone.
THE LIFE AND DEATH OF RICHARD THE THIRD ACT I, SCENE I London. A street. Enter GLOUCESTER (Richard, Duke of Gloucester). GLOUCESTER: Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York; And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front; And now, instead of mounting barded steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. But I—that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass; I—that am rudely stamp’d and want love’s majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I—that am curtail’d of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, Deformed, unfinish’d, sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up— And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them— Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, Have no delight to pass away the time, Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity.
THE JEW OF MALTA By Christopher Marlowe THE PROLOGUE Enter MACHIAVEL. MACHIAVEL: Albeit the world think Machiavel is dead, Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps; And now the Guise is dead, is come from France To view this land, and frolic with his friends. To some perhaps my name is odious; But such as love me, guard me from their tongues, And let them know that I am Machiavel, And weigh not men, and therefore not men's words. Admir’d I am of those that hate me most: Though some speak openly against my books, Yet will they read me, and thereby attain To Peter’s chair: and when they cast me off, Are poison’d by my climbing followers. I count religion but a childish toy, And hold there is no sin but ignorance. Birds of the air will tell of murders past! I am asham’d to hear such fooleries. Many will talk of title to a crown: What right had Caesar to the empery? Might first made kings, and laws were then most sure When, like the Draco’s, they were writ in blood. Hence comes it that a strong-built citadel Commands much more than letters can import: Which maxim had [Phalaris] observ’d, H’ad never bellow’d, in a brazen bull, Of great ones’ envy. O! then we bring forth weeds, When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us Is as our earing. Farewell, kind Machiavel. Exit.
THE RAIGNE OF KING EDWARD THE THIRD ACT I, SCENE I. Enter King Edward and Countess of Salisbury. KING EDWARD: Pardon me, Countess, I will stay no more; Lest being stay’d, I prove importunate. My tongue could plead, but I will spare it now; And give thee time to chide me, if thou canst. COUNTESS: To chide thee, Edward? If I should, I think Thou wouldst wilt under it, like a tall ship With too much sail under her noble keel. KING EDWARD: No, Countess, no; I am a soldier’s son: And bear a soldier’s heart, I think, I think: And therefore would I have my love forgot. Thou art no match for me. COUNTESS: I am no match for you? Why then, what am I? KING EDWARD: A woman! In my estimation Worth ten such Kings as I am. O, forgive me. That thus I do forget myself in thee. COUNTESS: I am your loyal subject, gracious lord, Not your equal. KING EDWARD: I know it well. Yet—let me pause. For in thy sight I see a thousand virtues, And in thy words a sweet persuasiveness, Which brings my passions to a treble height. But yet—I must not speak of this again.
