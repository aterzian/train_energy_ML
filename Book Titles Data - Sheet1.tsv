I am a very old man; how old I do not know. Possibly I am a hundred, possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I have always been a man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection. I do not know why I should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality. Because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death. I cannot explain the phenomena; I can only set down here the words of truth. I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate.
My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in everything but the management of his family, of which he had the total control, having been unfortunately deprived of the society of his wife at the time of the birth of their second son. My parents had given me the education which a fortune of more than moderate ease could afford, and I was, in every respect, a remarkably well-behaved and intelligent boy. The sea had always exercised a strong influence over my imagination, and many of the most intense and most pleasurable hours of my early boyhood were spent in poring over the pages of old voyages, especially those of Captain Cook, and in relating the adventurous deeds of travelers who had penetrated into the remote regions of the world. This desire to travel had been long growing in my mind. I had made many voyages with a friend of mine, Augustus Barnard — son of Barnard, a captain in the merchant service — and sometimes we were absent from home for days together.
I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days — found myself doubtful again, seemed to myself, I suppose, a fool; had had nothing from him but a charming dinner and the glimpse of a great possibility; had found myself, for it so fell out, at the end of forty-eight hours, at the house of a friend in London. It was ten o’clock at night, and the house was still — it was all the more still the dim summer dusk was deepening — and I sat for an hour, dazed, as it were, in the flicker of the fire. He had told me so little — told me nothing, in fact, but that he had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small boy and girl, children of a younger and a favorite brother, that he had been requested by the dying man to take them, and that, in the interest of their education, he was keen to place them in a country home, under the care of a young woman he could absolutely trust.
When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again. I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained.
Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnam Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess, the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical changes, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire. “Hark at the wind,” said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it. “I’m listening,” said the latter grimly, surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. “Check.” “I should hardly think that he’d come to-night,” said his father, with his hand poised over the board.
In the country of Westphalia, in the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh, lived a young man whom nature had endowed with the most agreeable manners. His countenance was the true index of his mind. He had a solid judgment joined to the most unaffected simplicity; and hence, I presume, he was called Candide. The old servants of the house suspected that he was the son of the Baron’s sister, by a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would never marry because he had not the quarterings of nobility. The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had a door and windows. His great hall even bore a tapestry. All the dogs of his farmyards composed a hunting pack in time of need. His grooms were his huntsmen, and the curate of the village was his chaplain. They all called him My Lord, and laughed when he told stories.
From my grandfather Verus, [I learned] good morals and the government of my temper. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally. From my governor, to endure labour, and to want little; to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people's affairs; and not to accept favors from others...
The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it): "To any one who has studied geometry, the truth that Time is only a kind of Space is a familiar as well as an uncontroversial conclusion. But I have experimental verification. It would be remarkably easy to show you. For instance, here is a four-dimensional diagram..."
It was four o'clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive. There had been some delay at the church, and the reception had to be shortened. There was no great loss, however, for there was only a hired hall and a few decorations, and the guests were in no mood to lose time. It was a Lithuanian wedding, and they had made all the preparations themselves, with only the help of a caterer and a few hired waiters. Now that the vows had been said, they could eat and drink and be merry. The hall was in the back room of a saloon, and already there was music and dancing and laughter. In the corner was a band, drawn from all the talents of the neighborhood — fiddles and a cimbalom, with one solitary harp-like instrument, and a bass viol as large as a man. There were tables and tables of food — roast pork and stewed chicken, boiled potatoes and cabbage, and great piles of rye bread. There was homemade beer and homemade sausage, and even homemade wine.
In the Valley of Doom, on the edge of the Land of Fable, where the mountains of Zark find their ending, and the country is of gentle hills and little valleys full of the sound of streams, there lies a village called Somnalin. It is a very little village, with no road leading to it, so that no one has ever been there except by chance, and only a few by chance ever find it again. A few forsaken cottages and one or two small gardens, with flowers that grow nowhere else in the world, stand here and there about the village. And once there came to Somnalin the Man-Horse. Whence he came none knew, for he was of the stock of the Centaurs. But the Centaurs live in the glades of myth, and not in the fields we know.
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversation?” So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet…
I have often been asked how I first came to be a regular opium-eater, and have suffered some pain in answering the question. The answer, however, is simple enough, and the reader may be assured that I have no vanity to gratify in detailing the circumstances, as I have no reason to think that opium, even taken in moderation, has ever been any source of happiness to me. On the contrary, it has been for many years a source of severe sufferings and the object of a profound abhorrence. I took it: — in the first instance to check a nervous complaint — in the second, as an article of daily diet — in the third, as a solace for the miseries of a life of solitude and hard study. The pleasures which I have at any time derived from opium are neither very great nor very numerous; but I must try to recal them, as an act of justice to the drug. I was a hard student at Oxford — morbidly ambitious of intellectual distinctions, and well content to sacrifice all ordinary pleasures to them. My life was so quiet and monotonous, that even this brief statement seems a history.
The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name.The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.
Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule. We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Memo: get recipe for Mina.)
The will to truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect — what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story — yet it seems as if it were hardly begun. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? What in us really wants “truth”? Indeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause of this will — until we finally came to a complete standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We asked about the value of this will. Suppose we want truth: why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth stepped before us — or was it we who stepped before the problem?
Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said that he resembled Byron—at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old. Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on ’Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the “City”; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln’s Inn, or Gray’s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen’s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan’s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.
I was scarcely more than a boy when I first entered the army, and was immediately ordered out to join the troops in the campaign against the Turks. I had not yet grown the famous mustaches you now see — but I was strong, alert, and full of that fire and spirit which youth and honor inspire. I had scarcely reached the army before I distinguished myself. A detachment of the enemy had made a sudden attack on our outposts. The general, alarmed, called for a volunteer to carry orders to a distant regiment. I sprang forward at once. My horse was fleet, my courage high — I set off at full gallop, leaping hedge and ditch, river and ravine. At one moment, finding myself pursued by a squad of Turkish horsemen, I turned suddenly, fired both my pistols, and — would you believe it? — brought down three of them with two bullets! The third must have passed through the first man and lodged in the second. Such things are not uncommon with me.
Something there is that doesn’t love a wall, That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, And spills the upper boulders in the sun; And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there.
Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised. It is the only form of adventure in which you pack your troubles together and take them with you. The men who go out into the white world with sledges know that they may have to face a year or more of a life in which pain and discomfort are almost continual, and danger a frequent companion. There is a philosophical element in the preparation for such a journey, and the minds of those who undertake it must be toughened and trained to meet and endure hardship with stoicism and without complaint. Exploration for exploration’s sake is a good thing. The spirit which leads a man to endure hardness is as good a reason as any for doing it. The better the reason the more likely is he to do it thoroughly. To go and do something dangerous because somebody has to do it and you think you can do it as well as anybody else — that is good, too.
There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.
It is an ancyent Marinere, And he stoppeth one of three: “By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye, Now wherefore stoppest me? The Bridegroom’s doors are open’d wide, And I am next of kin; The Guests are met, the Feast is set,— May’st hear the merry din.” He holds him with his skinny hand, “There was a ship,” quoth he. “Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!” Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean toward each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter — but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness — a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the Sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild. But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapor that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow.
Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost. Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars.
The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the worldwide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend, Hercule Poirot, and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist. I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair. I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month’s sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior — an easy-going, rather sleepy-looking fellow, though he could be exceedingly energetic when he chose.
All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities. Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new. The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza; or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the Kingdom of Naples to the King of Spain. Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser, and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada, or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana.
Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with eagerness the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the promises of youth, and that the deficiencies of the present day will be supplied by the morrow; attend to the history of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia. Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty emperor, in whose dominions the Father of Waters begins his course—whose bounty pours down the streams of plenty, and scatters over half the world the harvests of Egypt. According to the custom which has descended from age to age among the monarchs of the torrid zone, Rasselas was confined in a private palace, with the other sons and daughters of Abyssinian royalty, till the order of succession should call him to the throne. The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the residence of the princes of the empire was a spacious valley in the kingdom of Amhara, surrounded on every side by lofty mountains.
Why, my dear Lucilius, do we complain of Nature? She has acted kindly; life, if you reckon its length by the standard of pleasure, is long; if by the standard of Nature, it is short: Nature has given us but a brief span, yet ample enough for virtuous living. But if we squander life in luxury and carelessness, and if we waste it on no worthy pursuit, when the hour arrives in which we must die, we perceive that we have not truly lived. Life is long if you know how to use it. You ask, then, why misfortune befalls good men? No evil can happen to a good man: contraries cannot combine. As light does not mingle with darkness, so virtue does not mix with misfortune.
It was the custom of the people to say, in the month of July, 1665, that a dreadful sickness was coming. The air was hot and oppressive, and the people felt a general unease. By the middle of June, the streets of London became deserted, and those who remained in the city looked apprehensive. The sick were soon seen in every part of the town, and those who were well began to stay indoors, fearing the infection. By the end of the month, the first cases of the plague were being reported, and it was clear that a pestilence was spreading rapidly. The city's authorities began to take notice, and it was soon evident that the danger was real. Families began to shut themselves away, hoping to avoid the disease. It was said that the first few deaths were so sudden and severe that people could hardly believe the news. As more bodies were carried out, and the burial grounds began to fill, the gravity of the situation became undeniable.
I was born in Boston, New England, on the 17th day of January, 1706. My father was a tallow-chandler and soap-boiler, a business that he carried on for some years. He was a pious, sensible, and very frugal man, and, as I later understood, his business provided a decent income for the family. I had a number of siblings, and my parents provided us with the essentials for our upbringing. When I was about ten years old, my father had me apprenticed to my brother James, a printer, with whom I learned the trade. James had a printing house in which he printed a newspaper, the New-England Courant. This was the first opportunity I had to work with books and the printed word, and it sparked a lifelong interest in reading and writing. Though my father was well-meaning in putting me to work with my brother, it was a difficult apprenticeship. My brother was strict, and at times, I felt as though he was too harsh. But the work taught me a great deal about the printing trade and, more importantly, the value of self-reliance and perseverance.
