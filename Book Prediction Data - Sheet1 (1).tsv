Who's there? Nay, answer me; stand and unfold yourself. Long live the King. You come most carefully upon your hour; 'tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed. For this relief, much thanks; 'tis bitter cold, and I am sick at heart. Have you had quiet guard? Not a mouse stirring. Well, good night; if you do meet the rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who’s there? Friends to this ground, and liegemen to the Dane. Give you good night. Farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved you? My place is taken. Holla, say, is Horatio there? A piece of him. Welcome, welcome; what, has this thing appeared again tonight? I have seen nothing. It is said to be but fantasy, and belief will not take hold touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us. Therefore have we entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night; that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it. Tush, tush, ’twill not appear. Sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears, so fortified against our story, what we two nights have seen. Well, sit we down, and hear the telling. Last night of all, when yond same star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns, at this dead hour, with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. In what particular thought to work I know not; but in the gross and scope of mine opinion, this bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the stray inexpressible few, that made him worthwhile. His father, an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of drowsing over the Encyclopædia Britannica, grew wealthy at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O'Hara. In consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his immense egotism, his penchant for leaving things unfinished, and his easy way of taking things for granted.
While I was silently pondering these things to myself and writing down my wretched lamentations, I saw standing over my head a woman of majestic appearance. Her eyes were bright as fire, and she seemed full of years, and yet not aged. Her stature was difficult to judge: at one moment she seemed of ordinary human size, but at another her head touched the sky, and when she lifted herself higher, she even penetrated the heavens. Her clothes were made of the finest thread and woven by the subtlest art, but they were now darkened by neglect and torn by violence. Letters of the Greek alphabet were embroidered on the hem—Π (Pi) and Θ (Theta)—and this, she told me later, was the insignia of Philosophy.
